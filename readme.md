Then change into your new `Map-Appplication-FE` directory and start a development server (available at http://localhost:5173):

    cd Map-Appplication-FE
    npm install
    npm start

To generate a build ready for production:

    npm run build

Then deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your server.  You can also run `npm run serve` to serve the results of the `dist` directory for preview.
